# odin-recipes

The Odin Project

Foundations Course

Project: Recipes

A recipes web page to practice all of the HTML knowledge i have gained so far. 
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Styling of the webpage will be minimal as the use of css will be limited or possibly not used at all. 


Notes to developer:

When you’re building your project, you will probably end up doing several **git add** + **git commit** cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with git **push origin main**.

When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit early and often. Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.
