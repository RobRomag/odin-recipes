The Odin Project

Foundations Course

Project: Recipes

A recipes web page to practice all of the HTML knowledge i have gained so far. 
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Styling of the webpage will be minimal as the use of css will be limited or possibly not used at all. 

Note: 
This website is a student project for learning HTML and website development.
All recipes have been sourced from various websites, their links are provided at the
bottom of each page.
