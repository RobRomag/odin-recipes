# odin-recipes

The Odin Project

Foundations Course

Project: Recipes

A recipes web page to practice all of the HTML knowledge i have gained so far. 
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Styling of the webpage will be minimal as the use of css will be limited or possibly not used at all.
