  </div>
 

<h2>Ingredients List</h2>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>2  Whole fresh oranges</li>
      <li>2 3/4 Cups of Almond meal</li>
      <li>1 1/4 Cups of White Sugar</li>
      <li>6 Large Eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/4 tsp Baking powder</li>
    </ul>
  </div>        

<h2>Steps</h2>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place oranges in a pot and cover with cold water.
        Bring to the boil over medium high heat.<br>
        Boil for 10 minutes and drain.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat step one, two more times, put oranges back in the pot, cover 
        with cold water and boil again for another 10 minutes drain then 
        repeat one more time.<br>
        Basically boil the oranges three times for 
        ten minutes each time.<br>
        Alternatively you can boil them for 40 
        minutes without draining just keep adding water as required.<br>
        With the first option the cake flavour will be a bit cleaner because 
        you're discarding the bitter water, however its effect on the flavour
        is minimal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse oranges, cool them slightly so you can handle them.
        Chop them into smaller pieces ready for blending, remove any seeds then
        allow them to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F(140°C fan). Grease and line a 23cm cake 
        pan with baking paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chopped oranges in a food processor or blender. Blend on high until it's
        pureed into smooth consistency with only a few bits of rind remaining. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Add almond meal, eggs, baking powder and sugar. Blend on high until all 
        ingredients are combined approximately 5 to 10 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the mix into the prepared cake pan and bake for 60 minutes. When the 
        surface is golden and you can inserted a toothpick into the centre and 
        it comes out clean, its done!.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to cool and decorate as desired. Generally all thats required is a light
         dusting of icing sugar.
         "ENJOY!!"
      </li>
    </ol>
